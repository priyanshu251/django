# detailed explaination of signals
        
  # Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. Theyâ€™re especially useful when many pieces of code may be interested in the same events.
        
  # @receiver(post_save, sender=User): This is a decorator that connects the create_auth_token function to the post_save   signal emitted by the User model. The post_save signal is sent after a model's save method is successfully called. In   this case, it specifies that the create_auth_token function should be called whenever a User instance is saved.
        
  # def create_auth_token(sender, instance=None, created=False, **kwargs):: This function is the signal handler. It is   called when the post_save signal is emitted for the User model.

  # sender: The model class that sent the signal (User in this case).
        
  # instance: The actual instance of the model that was saved. It represents the User instance in this context.
        
  # created: A boolean indicating whether the instance was created (True if the instance is newly created, False if it   already existed and was updated).
        
  # **kwargs: A catch-all for any additional keyword arguments. In this case, it allows the function to accept any   additional parameters that may be passed by the signal.
        
  # if created: Token.objects.create(user=instance): This condition checks if the User instance was newly created. If   created is True, it means a new User instance was just created, and the code inside the block will execute.

  # Token.objects.create(user=instance): This line creates a new authentication token for the user (instance) using the   Token.objects.create() method. It associates the token with the specific user.
        
  # In summary, this signal handler function is connected to the post_save signal of the User model. Whenever a new User   instance is created, it responds by creating a corresponding authentication token for that user using the Token.objects.  create() method. This is a common pattern in Django for automatically performing actions in response to certain events   (such as saving a model instance).
